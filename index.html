  <h1> Hi, I'm Tony </h1>
  <p> My name's Tony. I work in the charity sector and love technology. I've been learning bits of code on and off for the past few years. But now, at the tender age of 25, I've finally figured out what I want to do with my life - combine what I love to do with what I love to learn.
	<p> Joining Founders and Coders is the best way for me to do this. I don't just want to learn to code, or get a better job,  but to join something that I actually believe in. This is the reason I started working in charity and it's the reason I dont' see myself doing anything else.
